    <p>
        Do not leave this tab (your browser window) during the experiment and do not reload this tab! 
        If you do switch tabs/windows during the experiment (to check your mail or visit another website, for example),
        the experiment will end automatically and you will <strong>not receive credit</strong> for your participation.
        Repeated participation or resumption of the experiment is impossible.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subtitle"> After finishing the experiment</h2>
    After finishing the experiment, you will automatically be redirected to the Prolific website.
    Closing the browser window prematurely will make the allocation of your participation credit impossible.<br>

    Respectively, deletion of your data will not be possible after data collection has been
    completed, as we cannot retrace your data-set.

    and will be made available to other researchers
    and/or in a data archive on the Internet
    as a means of transparency and to enable subsequent re-use in science.
    This will happen in an anonymized format, so that no data can be
    traced back to a specific person. </p>
